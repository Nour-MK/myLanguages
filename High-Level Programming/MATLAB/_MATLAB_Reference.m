% Name comes from MATrix LABoratory
% The matrix-based MATLAB language is the world's most natural way to express computational mathematics. Built-in graphics make it easy to visualize (in 2D and 3D) and gain insights from data.
% MATLAB language can be compiled and on;y produces results inside Mathworks' MATLAB. VS Code doesn't work except for syntax highlighting.
% If you don't assign a variable to the calculation you commanded MATLAB to do, the answer will be saved in a variable called ans. And if you do another calculation without assigning its output to a variable then the value in the default-created ans will be updated.
% If you don't add a semicolon at the end of a command, MATLAB will execute the command and display the result in the Command Window. This can be useful for debugging or when you want to see the intermediate results of your calculations.
% If you add a semicolon at the end of a command, MATLAB will execute the command, but it will suppress the output from being displayed in the Command Window. This is useful when you don't want to clutter the console with intermediate results. The result is still computed and stored in memory, but it's not shown in the console.

% Different Windows & What They're For (You may double click on the header of the window to expand it to the screen size):
% Editor: to write MATLAB scripts.
% Command Window: to give MATLAB its input and view its outputs.
% Workspace: shows you all of your current working variables and other objects.
% To display all 3, go to the Home tab - Layout - Three Column

% Questions:
% 1. Add the numbers 4 and 3 together? 
4 + 3 % ans = 7
% 2. Assign the 4+3 calculation to a variable named x?
x = 4 + 3 % x = 7
% 3. Enter the command x=x+1 to see what happens?
x = x + 1 % x = 8
% 4. Create a variable named y that has the value x*4?
y = x * 4 % y = 32
% 5. Enter z = 6 - 2 with a semicolon at the end
